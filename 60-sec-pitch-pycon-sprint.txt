coala does a broad variety of code analyses and fixes, such as code style
fixes or security analysis.

It supports way over 30 languages in addition to language independent
routines. So, instead of building new analysis tools from scratch you can now
build logic only and let coala deal with the user.

DUMB!

So, coala is 8 man years of effort going into usability.

We want you to come to our sprint so we can help you analyze your project,
write new code analysis, add support for your favourite language - given you
find one that's missing - or help you getting started contributing to open
source projects in general.

And by the way: there will be chocolate and free steam keys involved as well.
